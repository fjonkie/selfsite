        `hiya!! :3 im not good at writing or whatever so ill just list off various things about me
        i live in agder, norway
        i like mostly anything that has something to do with computers (programming, pc building, fiddling around in linux, modding nintendo consoles and installing custom roms)
        i have a severe case of brainrot
        unreliable, needs someone to rely on, pathetic and apathetic
        im usually very direct
        i tend to be affectionate towards people when i first meet them and then forget how to talk after a few days
        im horrible at keeping up conversations except if im playing a game with you
        im comfortable with vc (if you dont mind my voice) and im avaliable like a lot
        you can ask or tell me just about anything as there is a very low chance i would mind
        oh yeah im also like horrible at coming up with stuff like this so if theres anying youre curious about like actually please ask me i love answering questions (unless theyre about my body)
        when i have nothing to say, my lips are sealed
        if you made it here thats cool &lt;3`,
