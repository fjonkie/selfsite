        <br>\
        i live in agder, norway\
        <br>\
        i like mostly anything that has something to do with computers (programming, pc building, fiddling around in linux, modding nintendo consoles and installing custom roms)\
        <br>\
        i have a severe case of brainrot\
        <br>\
        unreliable, needs someone to rely on, pathetic and apathetic\
        <br>\
        im usually very direct\
        <br>\
        i tend to be affectionate towards people when i first meet them and then forget how to talk after a few days\
        <br>\
        im horrible at keeping up conversations except if im playing a game with you\
        <br>\
        im comfortable with vc (if you dont mind my voice) and im avaliable like a lot\
        <br>\
        you can ask or tell me just about anything as there is a very low chance i would mind\
        <br>\
